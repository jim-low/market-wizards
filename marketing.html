                <li>Assess the attractiveness of its various SBUs and decides how much support each deserves.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Strategic Planning purpose is to find ways which the company can better use its strengths to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the environment.Most portfolio analysis methods evaluate SBUs on two important dimensions:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Attractiveness of the SBU’s market or industry</li>
                <li>Strength of the SBU’s position in that market or industry.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Classification of company’s SBUs.Firstly, the Market growth rate which is to measure market attractiveness.Second, relative market share is to measure of company strength in the market.The growth-share matrix defines four types of SBUs.

              <li>Stars are high-growth, high-share</li>
              <li>Cash cows, are low-growth, high-share</li>
              <li>Question marks are low-share business units in high-growth markets.</li>
              <li>ogs are low-growth, low-share</li>
              <p>

              <ol>
                <li>market penetration- make more sales to current customers without changing the original products.</li>
                <li>market development- identifying and developing new markets for its current products.</li>
                <li>product development by offering modified or new products to current markets.</li>
                <li>Diversification- buying businesses beyond the firm’s current products and markets.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>

              </p>
              <li>The customer value delivery networks- network made up of the company, its suppliers, its distributors, and its customers who partner with each other to improve the performance of the entire system.</li>
              <li>Competition takes place between the entire value delivery networks created by these competitors.For example, Toyota’s performance against Ford depends on the quality of Toyota’s overall value delivery network versus Ford’s. Even if Toyota makes the best cars, it might lose in the marketplace if Ford’s dealer network provides more customer-satisfyingsales and service.</li>

              <li>Marketing management cannot always control environmental forces. Mostly, it must settle for simply watching and reacting to the environment.</li>
