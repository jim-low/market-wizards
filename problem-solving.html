                <h3>What you can learn from business problem solving?</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding the importance of problem-solving skills in the workplace will help you develop as a leader. Problem-solving skills will help you resolve critical issues and conflicts that you come across. Problem-solving is a valued skill in the workplace because it allows you to:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Apply a standard problem-solving system to all challenges</li>
                    <li>Find the root causes of problems</li>
                    <li>Quickly deal with short-term business interruptions</li>

                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>What is the benefits of problem solving?</h3>
                <p>
                  Therefore, team problem-solving method increases communication and better understanding between a group of people and this ultimately helps to solve the issues as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the problem solving</h3>
                <p>Creating a startup, or managing any business, is all about problem solving. Some people are good at it and some are not – independent of their IQ or their academic credentials (there may even be an inverse relationship here). Yet I’m convinced that problem solving is a learnable trait, rather than just a birthright
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Entrepreneurs who are great problem solvers within any business are the best prepared to solve their customers’ needs effectively as well. In fact, every business is about solutions to customer problems – no problems, no business. Problems are an everyday part of every business and personal environment.

            <div class="chapter chapter1">
                <h2>chapter 1: Take the time to define the problem clearly</h2>
                <p>
                  Many executives like to jump into solution mode immediately, even before they understand the issue. In some cases, a small problem can become a big one with inappropriate actions. In all cases, real clarity will expedite the path ahead.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter2">
                <h2>chapter 2: Pursue alternate paths on “facts of life” and opportunities</h2>
                <p>
                  Remember, there are some things that you can do nothing about. They’re not problems; they are merely facts of life. Often, what appears to be a problem is actually an opportunity in disguise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter3">
                <h2>chapter 3: Challenge the definition from all angles</h2>
                <p>
                  Beware of any problem for which there is only one definition. The more ways you can define a problem, the more likely it is that you will find the best solution. For example, “sales are too low” may mean strong competitors, ineffective advertising, or a poor sales process.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter4">
              <h2>chapter 4: Iteratively question the cause of the problem</h2>
              <p>
                This is all about finding the root cause, rather than treating a symptom. If you don’t get to the root, the problem will likely recur, perhaps with different symptoms. Don’t waste time re-solving the same problem.
              </p>
           </div>
           <div class="chapter chapter5">
            <h2>chapter 5: Identify multiple possible solutions</h2>
            <p>
              The more possible solutions you develop, the more likely you will come up with the right one. The quality of the solution seems to be in direct proportion to the quantity of solutions considered in problem solving.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter6">
                <h2>chapter 6: Make a decision</h2>
                <p>
                  Select a solution, any solution, and then decide on a course of action. The longer you put off deciding on what to do, the higher the cost, and the larger the impact. Your objective should be to deal with 80% of all problems immediately. At the very least, set a specific deadline for making a decision and stick to it.

        <p>
          <h4>What makes a good problem solver?</h4>
          An ability to adapt and move with changing technology, customer behaviour and the business landscape is essential to be able to recognise when your business needs to change and to react accordingly. To some, this comes naturally, but for others, it is a learning curve. A good problem solver has the ability to step back and think pragmatically and to avoid an emotional reaction to the issue.
