				The history of <span>market wizards</span> began when there was a sharp decline in Malaysia's economics due to the pandemic we all know and fear the <span>covid-19</span>. Since then, the education industry has realised that it would be an major problem for them if students could not attend classes physically due to the declaration of the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/covid-19/gn-sop">Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)</a> rules by the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.my/">Ministry of Education (MoE)</a> to reduce the possibility and cases of the spread of the disease. In order to get around this situation, the education industry has converted <strong>one hundered percent</strong> of it's efforts to online teaching and online learning. Online learning or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning_(theory)">E-learning</a> has been a huge hit since 2020 and many are gaining benefits as well as skills by learning online without needing to leave the comfort of their home and being exposed to the deadly virus. Many people, not just students have now started upgrading, updating and increasing their knowledge, skills and practicality through the internet. It is to no surprise that we Market Wizards intends to do the same, not just to educate people but also to prove a point that education is indeed part of our daily life, as long as we live we will learn. With the help of technology, education has never been easier thanks to the portability of devices such as our smartphones and even laptops and the access to internet nearly anywhere as long as it has a stable connection. Education is free and it can be even more when one realises that education is not gained solely in classrooms or by colleges but also on the internet where there are people willing to guide and educate others, make them realise their mistakes and work towards correcting it. In order to have people realise this, we have developed this website which teaches valuable business and communication skills to anyone who has the determination and passion to learn and made it completely free to everyone as long as he or she has a device with access to the internet, our content will be accessible to anyone whom meets the requirements.
