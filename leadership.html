              <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
              <h2>The Nature of Leadership</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Leadership</strong> is the process by which a person exerts (use) influence over other people and inspires (encourage),motivates and directs their activities to help achieve group or organizational goals
              </p>
              <p>
                Leadership derives from the power and is similar to, yet distinct from, management. In fact, “leadership” and “management” are different. There can be leaders of completely unorganized groups, but there can be managers only of organized groups. Thus it can be said that a manager is necessarily a leader but a leader may not be a manager.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leadership is essential for managing. The ability to lead effectively is one of the keys to being an effective manager because she/he has to combine resources and lead a group to achieve objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leadership and motivation are closely interconnected. By understanding motivation, one can appreciate better what people want and why they act as they do. A leader can encourage or dampen workers’ motivation by creating a favorable or unfavorable working environment in the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The essence of leadership is followership. In other words, it is the willingness of people to follow a person that makes that person a leader. Moreover, people tend to follow those whom they see as providing a means of achieving their desires, needs and wants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leadership involves an unequal distribution of power between leaders and group members. Group members are not powerless; they can shape group activities in some ways. Still, the leader will usually have more power than the group members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leaders can influence the followers’ behavior in some ways. Leaders can influence workers either to do ill or well for the company. The leader must be able to empower and motivate the followers to the cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                The leader must co-exist with the subordinates or followers and must have a clear idea about their demands and ambitions. This creates loyalty and trust in subordinates for their leader.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leadership is to be concerned about values. Followers learn ethics and values from their leaders. Leaders are the real teachers of ethics, and they can reinforce ideas. Leaders need to make positive statements of ethics if they are not hypocritical.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leading is a very demanding job both physically and psychologically. The leader must have the strength, power, and ability to meet the bodily requirements; zeal, energy, and patience to meet the mental requirements for leading.
              </p>

              <h2>chapter 2</h2>
              <h2>Quality of A Good Leader</h2>
              <p>
                A leader has got multidimensional traits in him which makes him appealing and effective in behavior. The following are the requisites to be present in a good leader:
              </p>
              <h4>1.Physical appearance</h4>
              <p>
                A leader must have a pleasing appearance. Physique and health are very important for a good leader.
              </p>
              <h4>2.Vision and foresight</h4>
              <p>
                A leader cannot maintain influence unless he exhibits that he is forward looking. He has to visualize situations and thereby has to frame logical programmes.
              </p>
              <h4>3.Intelligence</h4>
              <p>
                A leader should be intelligent enough to examine problems and difficult situations. He should be analytical who weighs pros and cons and then summarizes the situation. Therefore, a positive bent of mind and mature outlook is very important.
              </p>
              <h4>4.Communicative skills</h4>
              <p>
                A leader must be able to communicate the policies and procedures clearly, precisely and effectively. This can be helpful in persuasion and stimulation.
              </p>
              <h4>5.Objective</h4>
              <p>
                A leader has to be having a fair outlook which is free from bias and which does not reflects his willingness towards a particular individual. He should develop his own opinion and should base his judgement on facts and logic.
              </p>
              <h4>6.Knowledge of work</h4>
              <p>
                A leader should be very precisely knowing the nature of work of his subordinates because it is then he can win the trust and confidence of his subordinates.
              </p>
              <h4>7.Sense of responsibility</h4>
              <p>
                Responsibility and accountability towards an individual’s work is very important to bring a sense of influence. A leader must have a sense of responsibility towards organizational goals because only then he can get maximum of capabilities exploited in a real sense. For this, he has to motivate himself and arouse and urge to give best of his abilities. Only then he can motivate the subordinates to the best.
              </p>
              <h4>8.Self-confidence and will-power</h4>
              <p>
                Confidence in himself is important to earn the confidence of the subordinates. He should be trustworthy and should handle the situations with full will power.
              </p>
              <h4>9.Humanist</h4>
              <p>
                This trait to be present in a leader is essential because he deals with human beings and is in personal contact with them. He has to handle the personal problems of his subordinates with great care and attention. Therefore, treating the human beings on humanitarian grounds is essential for building a congenial environment.
              </p>
              <h4>10.Empathy</h4>
              <p>
                It is an old adage “Stepping into the shoes of others”. This is very important because fair judgement and objectivity comes only then. A leader should understand the problems and complaints of employees and should also have a complete view of the needs and aspirations of the employees. This helps in improving human relations and personal contacts with the employees.

              <h2>Style of Management Leadership</h2>
              <h3>Likert 4 Management Leadership Styles</h3>
              <p>Likert 4 Management Leadership Styles comes from the Famous psychologist Rensis Likert and his associates conducted an extensive survey of management and leadership patterns in a large number of organizations.They identified four styles of management or managerial leadership which are discussed briefly as under:</p>
              <h3>Style-1: Exploitative-Authoritative Leadership Style</h3>
              <p>
                In Exploitative-Authoritative Leadership Style; the manager has no confidence or trust in subordinates. Subordinates feel no freedom to discuss things about the job with their superior. In solving job problems, manager seldom gets ideas and opinions of subordinates.
              </p>
              <h3>Style-2: Benevolent-Autocratic Leadership Style</h3>
              <p>
                In Benevolent-Autocratic Leadership Style; the manager has condescending confidence and trust in subordinates, motivates with rewards and some punishments, permits some upward communication, solicits some ideas and opinions from subordinates and allows some delegation of decision making but with close policy control.
              </p>
              <h3>Style-3: Consultative Leadership Style</h3>
              <p>
                Consultative Leadership Style indicates that Manager has substantial but not complete confidence and trust in subordinates but still wishes to keep control of decisions. Subordinates feel free to discuss things about the job with their superior. The manager gets ideas and opinions and tries to make constructive use of them.
              </p>
              <h3>Style-4: Democratic Leadership Style</h3>
              <p>
                In the Democratic Leadership Style, the manager has complete confidence and trust in subordinates and allows them direct equal participation in decision making. Subordinates also feel completely free to discuss things about the job with their superior. The manager always asks subordinates for their ideas and opinions and makes constructive use of them.
              </p>
              <h3>Leadership Styles Based on Authority</h3>
              <p>
                Leadership styles refer to a leader’s behavior toward group members. The behavior pattern is that the leader reflects his role as a leader is described as style.Leadership style is the results of a leader’s philosophy, personality, and experience and value system.
              </p>
              <p>Leadership styles based on authority can be 4 types:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Autocratic Leadership</li>
                <li>Democratic or Participative Leadership</li>
                <li>Free-Rein or Laisse-Faire Leadership</li>
                <li>Paternalistic Leadership</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>1.Autocratic Leadership</h3>
              <p>
                Autocratic Leadership relies on coercion, and its style is paternalism, arbitrariness, command, and compliance. The autocratic leader gives orders which must be obeyed by the subordinates. He determines policies for the group without consulting them and does not give detailed information about plans, but simply tells the group what immediate steps they must take.
              </p>
              <p>
                Diagrammatically it may be shown in the following way. However, some autocratic leaders may happen to be “benevolent autocrats.” Generally, they are willing to hear and consider subordinates’ ideas and suggestions, but when a decision is to be made, they turn out to be more autocratic than benevolent.
              </p>
              <h3>Advantages of autocratic leadership</h3>
              <li>It is the speed with which decisions can be made; the leader does not have to obtain group members’ approval before deciding.</li>
              <h3>Disadvantages of autocratic leadership</h3>
              <li>Autocratic leadership does hurt group morale.</li>
              <li>Members may resent how decisions are made and thus support them in only a minimal fashion.</li>
              <h3>2.Democratic Leadership</h3>
              <p>
                The style of leadership that uses legitimate power can be classified as democratic leadership.A democratic leader usually gives instructions only after consulting with the group. He sees to it that policies are worked out in group discussion and with the acceptance of the group.That means democratic leadership solicits employees’ participation and respects their opinions. 
              </p>
              <h3>Advantages of democratic leadership</h3>
              <li>It often enhances the morale of the employees.</li>
              <li>It increases the acceptance of management’s ideas.</li>
              <li>It increases cooperation between management and employees.</li>
              <li>It leads to a reduction in the number of complaints and grievances.</li>
              <h3>Disadvantages of democratic leadership</h3>
              <li>It accounts for slow decisions, diluted accountability for decisions.</li>
              <li>There may be possible compromises that are designed to please everyone but does not give the best solution.</li>
              <h3>3.Free-Rein Leadership</h3>
              <p>
                The leadership style which allows maximum freedom to followers may be called free-rein leadership. It gives employees a high degree of independence in their operations.A free rein leader completely abdicates his leadership position, to give all responsibility of most of the work entrusted to him to the group which he is supposed to lead, limiting his authority to maintain the contact of the group with persons outside the group.This is also known as the permissive style of leadership.
              </p>
              <h3>Advantages of free rein leadership</h3>
              <li>Opportunity for individual development is offered to group members.</li>
              <li>All persons are given a chance to express themselves and to function relatively independently.</li>
              <h3>Disadvantages of free rein leadership</h3>
              <li>It may result in a lack of group cohesion and unity toward organizational objectives.</li>
              <li>Without a leader, the group may have little direction and a lack of control.</li>
              <li>The result can be inefficiency or even worse, chaos</li>
              <h3>4.Paternalistic Leadership</h3>
              <p>
                Under Paternalistic Leadership, the leader assumes that his function is paternal or fatherly.
              </p>
              <p>
                His attitude is that of treating the relationship between the leader and the group as that of a family with the leader as the head of the family.He works to help, guide, protect, and keep his followers happily working together as members of a family.He provides them with good working conditions and employee services.
              </p>
              <p>
                This style has been successful, particularly in Japan because of its cultural background. It is said that employees under such leadership will work harder out of gratitude.This mode of leadership produces good and quick results if the followers are highly educated and brilliant, and have a sincere desire to go ahead and perform with responsibility.
              </p>

              <h2>chapter 4</h2>
              <h3>Ways To Develop a Great Leadership Skills</h3>
              <h3>Practice discipline</h3>
              <p>
                A good leader needs discipline. Developing discipline in your professional (and personal) life is a must in order to be an effective leader, and to inspire others to be disciplined as well. People will judge your capacity to lead by the amount of discipline you display at work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Demonstrate discipline at work by always meeting deadlines, keeping appointments, and ending meetings on time. If you are naturally disorganized, then you may have your work cut out for you, but you can always start small: try implementing good habits at home, like waking up early and getting daily exercise, and work your way up from there. 
              </p>
              <h3>Take on more projects</h3>
              <p>
                A great way to develop your leadership skills is to take on more responsibility. You don't have to take on more than you can handle, but you do need to do more than simply what's covered in your job description if you want to grow. Stepping out of your comfort zone is the only way you will learn anything new, and doing so will get you noticed by executives as someone who takes initiative. 
              </p>
              <h3>Learn to follow</h3>
              <p>
                A true leader has no problem yielding control to another person when appropriate. You should not feel threatened when someone disagrees with you, questions your thinking, or puts forth ideas of their own. Keep an open mind and give merit where merit is due. It won't always be easy, but if you learn to value and respect others on your team, they'll be more likely to step up to the plate for you. 
              </p>
              <h3>Develop situational awareness</h3>
              <p>
                A mark of a good leader is someone who can see the bigger picture, and anticipate problems before they occur. This is a valuable skill to have when handling complex projects with tight deadlines. The ability to foresee and provide suggestions for avoiding potential problems is invaluable for a leader. This ability also helps you recognize opportunities that others overlook, which will certainly earn you recognition.  
              </p>
              <h3>Inspire others</h3>
              <p>
                Being a leader means you are part of a team, and as a leader you should be able to motivate and inspire those you work with to collaborate as best they can. When a team member needs encouragement or guidance, offer it. Sometimes, all a person needs is someone to listen and be sympathetic. 
              </p>
              <h3>Keep learning</h3>
              <p>
                The best path to becoming a good leader is to always keep learning new things. It keeps your mind sharp, and your skills fresh. It primes you for new challenges that may come your way, which is always a good thing in a leader.
              </p>
              <h3>Empower your teammates</h3>
              <p>
                No one is the best at everything, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you can learn to be a good leader. Delegating tasks to others not only frees you up for things you do well, it also empowers other people on your team. 
              </p>
              <h3>Resolve conflicts</h3>
              <p>
                Don't be a manager from hell! Not everyone will get along all the time. Instead of ignoring interpersonal conflicts, hoping they will go away, address it by talking to those involved privately. Also, be open to reassigning team members if the conflict can't be resolved. 
              </p>
              <h3>Be a discerning listener</h3>
              <p>
                Becoming a leader doesn't mean you always have to be in the spotlight. An important trait of a good leader is someone who listens to suggestions, ideas, and feedback from other people, and build on them. Good listeners know that communication is not only about words, but picking up on non-verbal cues, such as eye contact and body language.
