              <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
              <h2>Introduction to Financial Management</h2>
              <p>
                In our present day economy, finance is defined as the provision of money at the time when it is required. Every enterprise, whether big, medium or small, needs finance to carry on its operations and to achieve its targets. In fact, finance is so indispensable today that it is rightly said to be the lifeblood of an enterprise. Without adequate finance, no enterprise can possibly accomplish its objectives.
              </p>
              <h3>The subject of finance has been traditionally classified into two classes:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Public Finance</li>
                <li>Private Finance</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Public finance deals with the requirements, receipts and disbursements of funds in the government institutions like states, local self-governments and central government. Private finance is concerned with requirements, receipts and disbursements of funds in case of an individual, a profit seeking business organisation and a non-profit organisation.
              </p>
                <h3>Thus, private finance can be classified into:</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Personal finance</li>
                  <li>Business finance</li>
                  <li>Finance of non-profit organisations</li>
                </ol>
              <p>
                Personal finance deals with the analysis of principles and practices involved in managing one’s own daily need of funds. The study of principles, practices, procedures, and problems concerning financial management of profit making organisations engaged in the field of industry, trade, and commerce is undertaken under the discipline of business finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The finance of non-profit organisation is concerned with the practices, procedures and problems involved in financial management of charitable, religious, educational, social and other similar organisations.
              </p>
              <h3>Meaning of Business Finance:</h3>
              <h3>It is composed of two words:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Business</li>
                <li>Finance</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Thus, it is essential to understand the meaning of the two words, business and finance, which is the starting point to develop the whole concept and meaning of the term business finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The word ‘business’ literally means a ‘state of being busy’. All creative human activities relating to the production and distribution of goods and services for satisfying human wants are known as business. It also includes all those activities which indirectly help in production and exchange of goods, such as, transport, insurance, banking and warehousing, etc.Broadly speaking, the term ‘business’ includes industry, trade and commerce.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finance may be defined as the provision of money at the time when it is required. Finance refers to the management of flows of money through an organisation. It concerns with the application of skills in the manipulation, use and control of money. Different authorities have interpreted the term ‘finance’ differently.
              </p>
              <h3>However, there are three main approaches to finance:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>The first approach views finance as to providing of funds needed by a business on most suitable terms. This approach confines finance to the raising of funds and to the study of financial institutions and instruments from where funds can be procured.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The second approach relates finance to cash.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The third approach views finance as being concerned with rising of funds and their effective utilisation.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Having studied the meaning of the two terms business and finance; we can develop the meaning of the term ‘business finance’ as an activity or a process which is concerned with acquisition of funds, use of funds and distribution of profits by a business firm. Thus, business finance usually deals with financial planning, acquisition of funds, use and allocation of funds and financial controls.
              </p>
                <h3>Business finance can further be sub-classified into three categories, viz.;</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Sole-propritory finance</li>
                  <li>Partnership firm finance</li>
                  <li>Corporation or company finance</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/generalUse/clip.jpg">
                <p>
                  The above classification of business finance is based upon the three major forms of organisation for a business firm. In sole proprietorship form of organisation, a single individual promotes, finances, controls and manages the business enterprise. He also bears the whole risk of business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A partnership, on the other hand, is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business and to share its profits and losses. It may come into existence either as a result of the expansion of sole-trade business or by an agreement between two or more persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The liability of the partners is unlimited and they collectively share the risks of the business. A joint stock company or a corporation is an association of many persons who contribute money or money’s worth to a common stock and employs it in some trade or business and who share profit and loss arising there from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the words of Chief Justice Marshall, “a corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of the law. Being a mere creation of law, it possesses only the properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it either expressly or as incidental to its very existence”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Corporation is a legal entity having limited liability, perpetual succession and a common seal. A corporation is regarded as something different from its owners. The assets of the corporation are owned by it rather than its members and a corporation’s liabilities are the obligations of the corporation, not the owners or the members.

							<h2>chapter 2</h2>
              <h2>Definition and Importance of Financial Management</h2>
              <p>
                Corporation finance or broadly speaking business finance can be defined as the process of rising, providing and administering of all money/funds to be used in a corporate (business) enterprise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wheeler defines business finance as, “That business activity which is concerned with the acquisition and conservation of capital funds in meeting the financial needs and overall objectives of business enterprise.”
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Guthmann and Dougall,<strong> “Business finance can be broadly defined as the activity concerned with the planning, raising, controlling and administering the funds used in the business”</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the words of Prather and Wert, “Business finance deals primarily with raising, administering and disbursing funds by privately owned business units operating in non-financial fields of industry.”
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, “Corporation finance deals with the financial problems of corporate enterprises. These problems include the financial aspects of the promotion of new enterprises and their administration during early development, the accounting problems connected with the distinction between capital and income, the administrative questions created by growth and expansion, and finally, the financial adjustments required for the bolstering up or rehabilitation of a corporation which has come into financial difficulties”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the scope of corporation finance is so wide as to cover the financial activities of a business enterprise right from its inception to its growth and expansion and in some cases to its winding up also. Corporation finance, usually, deals with financial planning, acquisition of funds, use and allocation of funds, and financial controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                To sum up in simple words, we can say that financial management as practiced by corporate (business) firms can be called corporation finance or business finance. Finance function has become so important that it has given birth to Financial Management as a separate subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                Financial management refers to that part of the management activity which is concerned with the planning and controlling of firm’s financial resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                It deals with finding out various sources for raising funds for the firm. The sources must be suitable and economical for the needs of the business. The most appropriate use of such funds also forms a part of financial management. As a separate managerial activity, it has a recent origin. This draws heavily on Economics for its theoretical concepts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the words of Weston and Brigham,<strong> “Financial management is an area of financial decision-making, harmonising individual motives and enterprise goals”</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Howard and upon are of the opinion that financial management is the application of the planning and control functions to the finance function.
              </p>
              <h3>Importance of Financial Management</h3>
              <p>
                Finance is the life blood and nerve centre of a business, just as circulation of blood is essential in the human body for maintaining life, finance is very essential to smooth running of the business. It has been rightly termed as universal lubricant which keeps the enterprise dynamic. No business, whether big, medium or small can be started without an adequate amount of finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right from the very beginning, i.e. conceiving an idea to business, finance is needed to promote or establish the business, acquire fixed assets, make investigations such as market surveys, etc., develop product, keep men and machine at work, encourage management to make progress and create values. Even an existing concern may require further finance for making improvements or expanding the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the importance of finance cannot be over-emphasised and the subject of business finance has become utmost important both to the academicians and practising managers. The academicians find interest in the subject because the subject is still in its developing stage and the practising managers are interested in the subject because among the most crucial decisions of a firm are those related to finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The importance of corporation finance (which is a constituent of business finance) has arisen because of the fact that present day business activities are predominantly carried on company or corporate form of organisation.
              </p>
              <h3>The advent of corporate enterprises has resulted into:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>The increase in size and influence of the business enterprises</li>
                <li>Wide distribution of corporate ownership</li>
                <li>Separation of ownership and management</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The above three factors have further increased the importance of corporation finance. As the owners (shareholders) in a corporate enterprise are widely scattered and the management is separated from the ownership, the management has to ensure the maximisation of owner’s economic welfare.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the present day capitalistic regime, the size of the business enterprises is increasing resulting into corporate empires empowered with a lot of social and political influence. This makes corporation finance all the more important.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, if we refer to corporation finance as the financial management practiced by business firms, the importance of financial management can well be described as the importance of corporation finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Financial management is applicable to every type of organisation, irrespective of its size, kind or nature. It is as useful to a small concern as to a big unit. A trading concern gets the same utility from its application as a manufacturing unit may expect.
              </p>
              <p>
                This subject is important and useful for all types of ownership organisations. Where there is a use of finance, financial management is helpful. Every management aims to utilise its funds in a best possible and profitable way. So this subject is acquiring a universal applicability.
              </p>

              <h2>Factors Influencing and Importance of Financial Decisions</h2>
              <p>
                There are a number of (both external as well as internal) factors that influence the financial decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h3>A list of the important external as well as internal factors influencing the decisions is given below:</h3>
              </p>
                <h3>External Factors:</h3>
                <p>
                  External factors refer to environmental factors within which a business enterprise has to operate. These factors are beyond the control and influence of the management. A wise management adopts policies that will be most suited to the present and prospective socio-economic and political conditions of the country.
                </p>
              <ol>
                <li>State of economy</li>
                <li>Structure of capital and money markets.</li>
                <li>Requirements of investors</li>
                <li>Government policy</li>
                <li>Taxation policy</li>
                <li>Lending policy of financial institutions.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Internal Factors:</h3>
              <p>
                Internal factors refer to those factors which are related with internal conditions of the firm such as nature of business, size of business, expected return, cost and risk, asset structure of business, structure of ownership, expectations about regular and steady earnings, age of the firm, liquidity in company funds and its working capital requirements, restrictions in debt agreements, control factor and attitude of the management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within the economic and legal environment of the country finance manager must take the financial decision, keeping in mind the numerous characteristics of the firm.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Nature and size of business</li>
                <li>Expected return, cost and risk</li>
                <li>Composition of assets</li>
                <li>Structure of ownership</li>
                <li>Trend of earnings</li>
                <li>Age of the firm</li>
                <li>Liquidity position</li>
                <li>Working capital requirements</li>
                <li>Conditions of debt agreements</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Importance of Financial Decisions</h3>
              <h3>1.Long-term Growth and Effect:</h3>
              <p>
                These decisions are concerned with long-term assets. These assets are helpful in production. Profit is earned by selling the goods so produced. It can, therefore, be said the more correct these decisions are, the greater will be the growth of business in the long run. In addition to that, these affect the future possibilities of the business.
              </p>
              <h3>2.Large Amount of Funds Involved:</h3>
              <p>
                Decisions regarding fixed assets are included in the preview of capital budgeting. A large amount of capital is invested in these assets. If these decisions turn out to be wrong, there occurs the heavy loss of capital which is a scarce resource.
              </p>
              <h3>3.Risk Involved:</h3>
              <p>
                Capital budgeting decisions are full of risk. There are two reasons for it. First, these decisions refer to a long period, and as such expected profits for several years are to be anticipated. These estimates may turn out to be wrong. Second, because of the heavy investment involved, it is very difficult to change the decision once taken.
              </p>
              <h3>4.Irreversible Decisions:</h3>
              <p>
                Nature of these decisions is such as cannot be changed so quickly. For instance, if soon after setting up a cotton mill, it is thought of changing it, then the old machinery and other fixed assets will have to be sold at the throwaway price. In doing so, the heavy loss will have to be incurred. Changing these decisions, therefore, is very difficult.

							<h2>Steps To Manage Your Money The Right Way</h2>
                <h3>1.Create a budget</h3>
                <p>
                  Creating and sticking to a budget might seem a little tough to achieve at first but it pays off in the end (no pun intended). Budgeting helps us see with clarity and full transparency our financial situation and this is of most importance for better managing your money.It’s the first step to help us pay off debt and start saving for future expenses such as a mortgage, a car, and your retirement. It’s what will bring balance to your financial life and give you peace of mind.To begin, you will need to understand your expenses and your income to better manage your money. This is addressed in the following 2 steps:
                </p>
                <h3>2.Understand your expenses</h3>
                <p>
                  Many people actually don’t know the total amount of expenses they generate on any given month. This is a problem but there is an easy solution for it. Here it is: for one month, keep track of all your expenses. Easy-peasy. Take all your receipts (groceries, restaurant bills, utilities, etc.) and look at your bank statements and add up all of your expenses. Remember to keep track of expenses paid by cash as well as credit cards.The idea is to have all your expenses (both variable and fixed) accounted for to get a total amount. This will allow you to see the whole picture and know how to manage your expenses going forward. You will also want to compare your historical performance over time.
                </p>
                <h3>3.Understand your income</h3>
                <p>
                  Ask anyone off the top of their head to tell you how much they make a month and although they probably won’t tell you, internally they know. This is the difference between income and expenses, most people know their full monthly income but have less knowledge of their full monthly expenses.Nonetheless, the point is to figure out your total expenses and subtract that from your total income for the month in question. Here is how the results should pan out:
                </p>
                <li>If you end up with a negative number this means you spent more than you made.  Actions to take? Reduce your spending and expenses until the total reaches zero.</li>
                <li>If you end up with a positive number this is good (high five!) and means you spent less you made.  Actions to take? You could increase your debt payments or increase your savings.</li>
                <p>
                  Once you understand your expenses and income and have a firm understanding of the money coming in and out of your life, it’s time to take some additional steps to best manage your money.
                </p>
                <h3>4.Consolidate your debt</h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing to do is to get it under control and work on getting rid of it. If you have credit card debts, student loans, and other debts; look to consolidate them and try to get the lowest interest rate possible.Again, its all about taking the proper steps to control your money. There are options out there that allow you to combine several unsecured debts such as credit cards, personal loans, and payday loans, into one bill rather than pay them individually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you only have a single credit card debt and are on a tight budget, try paying at least the minimum amount as soon as you get the credit card bill. Then, if your finances permit it, and you come across some more money, try to make the same payment a few weeks later.Try keeping this payment cycle going until your debt is fully paid off.
                </p>
                <h3>5.Slash or remove unnecessary expenses</h3>
                <p>
                  Big fan of Starbucks? If you are buying a Venti Caffe Latte every day (as delicious as they are) that’s around $4 out of your wallet. Multiply that out and you could be spending about $1,400 a year just on that. Maybe, just maybe, consider making your own blend at home to pinch those pennies? Paying for a gym membership but doing yoga in your backyard? Cancel it. Think long and hard of other memberships, subscriptions, accounts that you are paying for but could live without.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember, the idea is to learn how to manage your finances better by taking everything and every penny into account.So, do some spring cleaning and slash expenses wherever you see an opportunity and especially if it’s something that doesn’t affect your life to a great extent.
                </p>
                <h3>6.Create an emergency fund</h3>
                <p>
                  Emergency funds are an important part of a healthy personal finance plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In almost all cases, you shouldn’t touch or take money out of the fund, rather, let it sit there earning interest. If you lose your job or an unfortunate or unexpected expense arises—such as your car breaking down or a tree falling on your roof—this is when you should tap into it.
                </p>
                <h3>7.Save 10 to 15 percent for retirement</h3>
                <p>
                  First thing should be to establish a savings target—one that tells you approximately how much you should set aside over time to meet your retirement goals that will allow you to live the sort of lifestyle you envision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let’s say you are 21 years old and don’t have anything saved up but just got offered a job paying $40,000 a year. If you save 10% of your income annually then by the retirement age of 67, you will have $2.5 million saved up! Cha-ching!
                </p>
                <h3>8.Review and understand your credit report</h3>
                <p>
                  A credit report is a number roughly between 150 and 900 that serves as a score/grade which factors in your present and past loans, credit cards, mortgages, and any other reported debts.It serves to determine how creditworthy you are and this score has a direct impact on your future borrowing ability. It’s important that you review and understand your credit report to assure it has all your updated information and to identify any possible errors (it’s estimated that 2-3% of reports contain some errors that could affect your overall score).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you want to aim for a great credit score, keep your credit card balances low and work on paying off your debt instead of moving it from account to account.
                </p>
                <h3>9.Use a tool or personal finance app</h3>
                <p>
                  Begin by getting with the times and putting away your abacus or Casio calculator. There are new and free tools out there that will show you ways to manage money as well as do all the hard budgeting and computational work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many tools such as Quicken for Windows or the free MoneyStrands app will allow you to safely consolidate, manage and control your money all in one place.
                </p>
