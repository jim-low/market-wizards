                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>What you can learn from entrepreneurship?</h3>
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurship enhances creativity and boosts innovation. Being creative and innovative is something inside ourselves that needs to be developed. It's only through putting these abilities to work that you can improve them.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the benefits of entrepreneurship?</h3>
                <p>
                  Great entrepreneurs have the ability to change the way we live and work. If successful, their innovations may improve standards of living, and in addition to creating wealth with entrepreneurial ventures, they also create jobs and contribute to a growing economy.
                </p>
                <h3>What is Entrepreneurship?</h3>
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a business or businesses while building and scaling it to generate a profit.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However, as a basic entrepreneurship definition, it’s a bit limiting. The more modern entrepreneurship definition is also about transforming the world by solving big problems. Like initiating social change, creating an innovative product or presenting a new life-changing solution.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What the entrepreneurship definition doesn’t tell you is that entrepreneurship is what people do to take their career and dreams into their hands and lead it in the direction of their own choice. It’s about building a life on your own terms. No bosses. No restricting schedules. And no one holding you back. Entrepreneurs are able to take the first step into making the world a better place, for everyone in it.

                <h2>chapter 1: Take a stand for yourself</h2>
                <p>
                If you are dissatisfied with your current circumstances, admit that no one can fix them except for you. It doesn't do any good to blame the economy, your boss, your spouse or your family. Change can only occur when you make a conscious decision to make it happen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter2">
                <h2>chapter 2: Identify the right business for you</h2>
                <p>
                  Give yourself permission to explore. Be willing to look at different facets of yourself (your personality, social styles, age) and listen to your intuition. We tend to ignore intuition even though deep down we often know the truth. Ask yourself "What gives me energy even when I'm tired?"
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  How do you know what business is "right" for you? There are three common approaches to entrepreneurship:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Do what you know: Have you been laid off or want a change? Look at work you have done for others in the past and think about how you could package those skills and offer them as your own services or products.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Do what others do: Learn about other businesses that interest you. Once you have identified a business you like, emulate it.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Solve a common problem: Is there a gap in the market? Is there a service or product you would like to bring to market? (Note: This is the highest-risk of the three approaches.) If you choose to do this, make sure that you become a student and gain knowledge first before you spend any money.

            <div class="chapter chapter3">
                <h2>chapter 3: Business planning improves your chances for success</h2>
                <p>
                  Most people don't plan, but it will help you get to market faster. A business plan will help you gain clarity, focus and confidence. A plan does not need to be more than one page. As you write down your goals, strategies and action steps, your business becomes real.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Ask yourself the following questions:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What am I building?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Who will I serve?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What is the promise I am making to my customers/clients and to myself?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What are my objectives, strategies and action plans (steps) to achieve my goals?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter4">
              <h2>chapter 4: Know your target audience before you spend a penny</h2>
              <p>
                Before you spend money, find out if people will actually buy your products or services. This may be the most important thing you do. You can do this by validating your market. In other words, who, exactly, will buy your products or services other than your family or friends? (And don't say. "Everyone in America will want my product." Trust me -- they won't.) What is the size of your target market? Who are your customers? Is your product or service relevant to their everyday life? Why do they need it?
                <br>
                <br>
                There is industry research available that you can uncover for free. Read industry articles with data (Google the relevant industry associations) and read Census data to learn more. However, the most important way to get this information is to ask your target market/customers directly and then listen.
              </p>

          <div class="chapter chapter5">
            <h2>chapter 5: Understand your personal finances and choose the right kind of money you need for your business</h2>
            <p>
              As an entrepreneur, your personal life and business life are interconnected. You are likely to be your first -- and possibly only -- investor. Therefore, having a detailed understanding of your personal finances, and the ability to track them, is an essential first step before seeking outside funding for your business. This is why I recommend setting up your personal accounts in a money management system such as Mint.com to simplify this process.
              <br>
              <br>
              As you are creating your business plan, you will need to consider what type of business you are building -- a lifestyle business (smaller amount of startup funds), a franchise (moderate investment depending on the franchise) or a high-tech business (will require significant capital investment). Depending on where you fall on the continuum, you will need a different amount of money to launch and grow your business, and it does matter what kind of money you accept.

            <div class="chapter chapter6">
                <h2>chapter 6: Sell by creating value</h2>
                <p>
                  Even though we purchase products and services every day, people don't want to be "sold." Focus on serving others. The more people you serve, the more money you will make. When considering your customers or clients, ask yourself:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What can I give them?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  How can I make them successful in their own pursuits?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This approach can help lead you to new ways to hone your product or service and deliver more value, which your customers will appreciate.

          Entrepreneurism is a journey, or at least it has been for me. What my journey has revealed over the years is that, much like traditional professions, there is a learning curve that you must respect and allow for, to assure yourself some reasonable amount of success.
