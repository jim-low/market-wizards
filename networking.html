                <h3>What you will learn in networking?</h3>
                <p>
                  A business network of contacts is both a route to market for you, and a marketing method. Business networking offers a way to reach decision-makers which might otherwise be very difficult to engage with using conventional advertising methods
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Business networking brings with it the added advantage of recommendation and personal introduction, which are always very helpful for developing business opportunities.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Business networking is a way for you to make the maxim, "It's not what you know, it's who you know.." work for you.The principles and techniques of business networking are mostly common sense. Many of the behavioural principles apply also to business and relationships generally, and specifically to selling, managing, coaching, facilitating, etc.

                <h3>What is the benefits of networking?</h3>
                <p>
                  Business networking gives business people the ability to collaborate with other experts to help them grow their businesses or improve their professional lives. The benefits of business networking include: Opportunities to help other business owners. Receiving assistance from other owners.

                <h3>What is the business networking?</h3>
                <p>
                  Business networking is a term that refers to meeting other business owners, potential suppliers, or other professionals who have business experiences to help you grow your business. Networking gives you a pool of experts that range from competitors to clients, and allows you to offer something to them; hopefully in exchange for their services, advice, knowledge, or contacts
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Developing relationships as a business owner and offering assistance to others does more than give you potential clients or generate referrals. Networking assists you in identifying opportunities for partnerships, joint ventures, or new areas of expansion for your business.

                <h2>chapter 1：Choose the right venues</h2>
                <p>
                Not every group of people will be right for you. Choose groups where people congregate who share your interests and/or are potential clients. Chambers of Commerce, men’s and women’s organizations, networking groups, special interest groups, and associations are all potential choices. Or perhaps a MeetUp.com group in your area will appeal to you.

                <h2>chapter 2: Develop relationships</h2>
                <p>
                  Networking is not about selling, but rather developing relationships that can lead to sales or referrals. The idea is to get to know people and allow them to get to know you.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Often, people approach networking with the hope of making a sale or getting a client after one visit to an appropriate group. That’s not how it works. People do business with those they know and trust and it can take time to build up that knowledge and trust. So approach a networking event without any expectation of getting new business. Instead go with the idea of meeting new people or schmoozing with those you’ve already gotten to know.

                <h2>chapter 3: Dress appropriately and professionally</h2>
               <p>
                 Establish yourself as a successful person, which you can do by dressing the part. This does not mean that you need to wear expensive clothes, but do wear something a bit on the dressy side and leave the comfortable baggy pants at home. If necessary, get advice from an image consultant.

                   Bring plenty of business cards, but only give them to people who show a real interest in what you do. Brochures or printed postcards can also be effective. Also, craft a short description of what you do — no more than 10 or 15 seconds.

                <p>
                  Don’t spend all of your time talking to one person. Gather the information you need, exchange business cards, if appropriate, and move on. I often say, “I’d like to do some mixing now. It’s been a pleasure speaking to you.

                <p>
                  Many events have walk-around networking followed by a sit-down meeting of some sort. During the walk-around, do talk to people you have met before to enhance your relationship, but sit with people you don’t know in order to widen your network and meet potential customers. Here too, ask questions and listen
