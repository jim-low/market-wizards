                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>What you will learn in project management?</h3>
                <p>
                  Project management is essentially the practice of turning ideas into reality. Learning how the pros plan, budget, prioritize, and execute projects will help you do the same in your personal and professional life. A goal without a plan can set you up for hours, weeks, or even months of busy work.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the benefits of project management?</h3>
                <p>
                  improve your chances of achieving the desired result. gain a fresh perspective on your project, and how it fits with your business strategy. prioritise your business' resources and ensure their efficient use. set the scope, schedule and budget accurately from the start.
                </p>
                <h3>What is project planning?</h3>
                <p>
                  Project planning is the process of defining your objectives and scope, your goals and milestones (deliverables), and assigning tasks and budgetary resources for each step. A good plan is easily shareable with everyone involved, and it’s most useful when it’s revisited regularly. Simply outlining a plan and never discussing it with your team again is a good recipe for wasted time and effort.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  You can do your project planning in a simple Google doc, or you can use project management software. The benefit of using project management software is that you’re usually able to store all of your documents and deliverables in one place, and you can avoid losing important discussions and decisions to the email or Slack void. With a tool like Basecamp, for example, it’s easy to track progress and keep track of conversations and items that require collaboration with a few different people.

                <h2>chapter 1: Think of your plan as a roadmap for stakeholders</h2>
                <p>Think of your plan as a roadmap for stakeholders
                Every project needs a roadmap with clearly defined goals that should not change after the first phase of the project has been completed. All stakeholders benefiting from the outcome or involved in executing the project should be named and their needs stated during the initial project planning process.
                <br>
                <br>
                These stakeholders might include
                The project manager or the person ultimately responsible for completion
                The “customer” who receives the deliverables—this can be someone on your team (internal) or an actual paying customer
                The team, or the people responsible for any tactic that’s part of the plan.
                Don’t assume that you automatically understand each stakeholder’s needs and goals. Before you get too far into documenting your project plan, talk to them to make sure you really understand the project and abilities and resources of everyone on the team.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter2">
                <h2>chapter 2: Break the project into a list of deliverables</h2>
                
                <p>Develop a list of all deliverables. This list should break down the larger project into smaller tasks that can be assigned to specific team members, and you should include estimated deadlines associated with each deliverable or task.
                <br>
                <br>
                Make sure that you understand and document the approval process for each deliverable. If your project is for an external customer, make sure you are clear on their internal approval process, so that you’re not surprised by delays or slowed down with wading through competing opinions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter3">
                <h2>chapter 3: Identify risks</h2>
                <p>Determine the risks involved in your project. Think through what you’ll do if something takes much longer than expected, or if costs end up being much more than you initially anticipated.
                <br>
                <br>
                You don’t have to have a specific course of action identified for every possible negative outcome, but you should spend some time with your team, thinking through what could go wrong. Then, you can do as much as you can to mitigate those risks from the outset, rather than being caught off guard later. Risk factors can also have some influence on how you budget.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter chapter4">
                <h2>chapter 4: Talk to your team</h2>   
                <p>Identify by name all individuals and/or organizations involved in each deliverable or task, and describe their responsibilities in detail. Otherwise, miscommunication can lead to delays and situations where team members may have to redo their work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hold a kickoff meeting to talk to your team about your intended plan of attack. Ask them to help you think about the best way to get the work done. Not only will this help you be more efficient, it will help you get their buy-in because they’ll feel more ownership over the process. Using a project management tool like Basecamp can be helpful keeping everyone on track and storing documents and conversations all in one place.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you use email to communicate about projects, consider using a team inbox email solution that will allow you to assign emails that need project-related attention to team members as appropriate, rather than endlessly forwarding huge conversation threads back and forth.
