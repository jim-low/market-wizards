              <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
             <h2>What is Negotiation</h2>
             <p>
              Negotiation is a method by which people settle differences. It is a process by which compromise or agreement is reached while avoiding argument and dispute.In any disagreement, individuals understandably aim to achieve the best possible outcome for their position (or perhaps an organisation they represent). However, the principles of fairness, seeking mutual benefit and maintaining a relationship are the keys to a successful outcome.
             </p>
             <p>
              Specific forms of negotiation are used in many situations: international affairs, the legal system, government, industrial disputes or domestic relationships as examples. However, general negotiation skills can be learned and applied in a wide range of activities. Negotiation skills can be of great benefit in resolving any differences that arise between you and others.
             </p>
             <h3>Stages of Negotiation</h3>
             <p>
              In order to achieve a desirable outcome, it may be useful to follow a structured approach to negotiation. For example, in a work situation a meeting may need to be arranged in which all parties involved can come together.
             </p>
             <p>
              The process of negotiation includes the following stages:
             </p>
             <ol>
               <li>Preparation</li>
               <li>Discussion</li>
               <li>Clarification of goals</li>
               <li>Negotiate towards a Win-Win outcome</li>
               <li>Agreement</li>
               <li>Implementation of a course of action</li>
             </ol>
             <h3>1.Preparation</h3>
             <p>
               <strong>Before any negotiation takes place, a decision needs to be taken as to when and where a meeting will take place to discuss the problem and who will attend.  Setting a limited time-scale can also be helpful to prevent the disagreement continuing.</strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              This stage involves ensuring all the pertinent facts of the situation are known in order to clarify your own position.  In the work example above, this would include knowing the ‘rules’ of your organisation, to whom help is given, when help is not felt appropriate and the grounds for such refusals.  Your organisation may well have policies to which you can refer in preparation for the negotiation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Undertaking preparation before discussing the disagreement will help to avoid further conflict and unnecessarily wasting time during the meeting.
             </p>
             <h3>2.Discussion</h3>
             <p>
               <strong>
                During this stage, individuals or members of each side put forward the case as they see it, i.e. their understanding of the situation. 
               </strong>
             </p>
             <p>Key skills during this stage include questioning, listening and clarifying.</p>
             <p>Sometimes it is helpful to take notes during the discussion stage to record all points put forward in case there is need for further clarification.  It is extremely important to listen, as when disagreement takes place it is easy to make the mistake of saying too much and listening too little.  Each side should have an equal opportunity to present their case.</p>
             <h3>3.Clarifying Goals</h3>
             <p>
               <strong>From the discussion,the goals ,interests and viewpoints of both sides of the disagreement need to be clarified</strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              It is helpful to list these factors in order of priority.  Through this clarification it is often possible to identify or establish some common ground. Clarification is an essential part of the negotiation process, without it misunderstandings are likely to occur which may cause problems and barriers to reaching a beneficial outcome.
             </p>
             <h3>4.Negotiate Towards a Win-Win Outcome</h3>
             <p>
              This stage focuses on what is termed a 'win-win' outcome where both sides feel they have gained something positive through the process of negotiation and both sides feel their point of view has been taken into consideration.
             </p>
             <p>
               A win-win outcome is usually the best result. Although this may not always be possible, through negotiation, it should be the ultimate goal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Suggestions of alternative strategies and compromises need to be considered at this point.  Compromises are often positive alternatives which can often achieve greater benefit for all concerned compared to holding to the original positions.
             </p>
             <h3>5.Agreement</h3>
             <p>
              Agreement can be achieved once understanding of both sides’ viewpoints and interests have been considered. 
             </p>
             <h3>Failure to Agree</h3>
             <p>If the process of negotiation breaks down and agreement cannot be reached, then re-scheduling a further meeting is called for.  This avoids all parties becoming embroiled in heated discussion or argument, which not only wastes time but can also damage future relationships.</p>
             <p>
              At the subsequent meeting, the stages of negotiation should be repeated.  Any new ideas or interests should be taken into account and the situation looked at afresh.  At this stage it may also be helpful to look at other alternative solutions and/or bring in another person to mediate.
             </p>
             <h3>Informal Negotiation</h3>
             <p>
               <strong>There are times when there is a need to negotiate more informally.  At such times, when a difference of opinion arises, it might not be possible or appropriate to go through the stages set out above in a formal manner.Nevertheless, remembering the key points in the stages of formal negotiation may be very helpful in a variety of informal situations. </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              In any negotiation, the following three elements are important and likely to affect the ultimate outcome of the negotiation:
             </p>
             <ol>
               <li>Attitudes</li>
               <li>Knowledge</li>
               <li>Interpersonal Skills</li>
             </ol>
             <h3>1.Attitudes</h3>
             <p>
              All negotiation is strongly influenced by underlying attitudes to the process itself, for example attitudes to the issues and personalities involved in the particular case or attitudes linked to personal needs for recognition.
             </p>
             <p>
               Always be aware that:
             </p>
             <li>Negotiation is not an arena for the realisation of individual achievements.</li>
             <li>There can be resentment of the need to negotiate by those in authority.</li>
             <li>Certain features of negotiation may influence a person’s behaviour, for example some people may become defensive.</li>
             <h3>2.Knowledge</h3>
             <p>
               The more knowledge you possess of the issues in question, the greater your participation in the process of negotiation.  In other words, good preparation is essential.
             </p>
             <p>Do your homework and gather as much information about the issues as you can.Furthermore, the way issues are negotiated must be understood as negotiating will require different methods in different situations.</p>
             <h3>3.Interpersonal Skills</h3>
             <p>Good interpersonal skills are essential for effective negotiations, both in formal situations and in less formal or one-to-one negotiations.These skills include:</p>
             <li>Effective Verbal Communication</li>
             <li>Listening</li>
             <li>Reducing misunderstandings</li>
             <li>Rapport Building</li>
             <li>Problem Solving</li>
             <li>Decision Making</li>
             <li>Assertiveness</li>
             <li>Dealing with Difficult Situations</li>

              <h2>chapter 2</h2>
              <h2>Types of Negotiation Skills</h2>
              <p>
                Business people who are looking for effective negotiation strategies often confront a dizzying array of advice. It can be useful to take a step back and categorize these strategies into various types of negotiation tactics. Highlighting the benefits of negotiation in business, the following five types of negotiation tactics can help you think more broadly about how to get a great deal.
              </p>
              <h3>1.Set-up Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                Well before they sit down at the table, negotiators typically make a number of decisions, small and large, that can have a dramatic effect on how their talks unfold. One of the most important questions to ask is whom you should be negotiating with to meet your goals. Look beyond your final target: You might make the most progress by negotiating first with people who can influence him or her. Another key question is whether to negotiate online (via email, videoconferencing, or text messages), on the telephone, or in person—or a combination of all of these formats. Meeting in person is often ideal, but other communication media have their advantages. When meeting in person, should you meet at your office or theirs? Meeting at your place may be most comfortable, but traveling shows your commitment and allows for valuable information gathering.
              </p>
              <h3>2.Value-creating Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                People often view negotiation as a win-lose enterprise, but in most situations, a win-win mindset will lead to better results. Adding issues to the discussion is often the key to value creation and a great deal. For example, in a corporate negotiation about a merger, in addition to discussing valuation and price, parties can discuss personnel issues, headquarters location, long-term strategic plans, and so on. Then explore tradeoffs based on each party’s preferences. Other promising value-creation strategies include asking lots of questions to learn about what matters to your counterpart and sharing information about your own interests and priorities.
              </p>
              <h3>3.Value-claiming Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                Taking a collaborative approach to negotiation doesn’t negate the importance of claiming a fair share of the value you’ve jointly created. Effective value claiming should be based on a thorough analysis of what you want out of the negotiation as well as what the other party wants. Be sure to spend time thinking about your BATNA, or best alternative to a negotiated agreement—what you’ll do if you fail to reach your goals in the current negotiation—and try to discover what your counterpart’s BATNA might be as well. Negotiators often find they can effectively claim value by making an ambitious first offer, but you’ll need to have a solid sense of the bargaining zone. Research shows that the person who makes the first offer often anchors the negotiation to their advantage.
              </p>
              <h3>4.Persuasion Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                In negotiation, how you present your proposals can influence your counterpart at least as much as what those proposals include. How you frame information affects whether your counterpart views your offer as a promising or disappointing, and whether they’ll want to deal with you over the long term. One proven persuasion tactic is to make several offers simultaneously rather than just presenting one offer. Be sure that you value each offer equally so you won’t be disappointed by the other party’s choice. There are a number of other persuasion techniques you can use in negotiation, such as drawing on the power of silence, presenting a draft agreement, and looking for ways to get your foot in the door.
              </p>
              <h3>5.Defensive Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                It would be nice if negotiation were always just a matter of two reasonable people using negotiating techniques and skills as they work patiently toward agreement, but we often hit roadblocks anyway. When we encounter deceptive tactics in negotiation, threats, and other unethical or hard bargaining moves, we need to have some defensive tactics ready to deploy. To some extent, we can avoid the need to play defense by taking time to get to know the other party and try to build rapport and trust before getting down to business. If any red flags pop up, take a break to research your suspicions and weigh carefully whether to proceed. At the negotiating table, effective defensive tactics include explicitly agreeing upfront to behave in an honest, forthright manner; conveying that you have a strong BATNA; and making your counterpart aware of your connections to their organization and social network.

              <h2>chapter 3</h2>
              <h2>Communication Techniques for Negotiators</h2>
              <h3>1. Know Your Purpose For The Conversation</h3>
              <p>
                On what are you willing to negotiate? What are your critical points and your non-negotiables? Know your audience. People generally fall into four categories of business personality:<strong> The Driver, The Amiable, The Analytic, or The Expressive.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Driver types are straight and to the point, very focused on business and not interested in your personal life. They want to see profit and success and will need for you to explicitly state how your partnership will help them be successful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Amiable types care strongly about relationships and they go into business with people they like. They want to get to know you and want you to make them feel comfortable with the business opportunity. It usually takes them awhile to make decisions because you have to talk them through each of the steps – they like to take everyone’s opinion into consideration before making a decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Analytic types need a spreadsheet. They like to see the numbers and will know if it works for their company or not based solely on the spreadsheet. They are usually a bit more reserved and do not like to have large amount of conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Expressive types are similar to drivers, but have a stronger focus on relationships. They will make the best decision for their company in a timely manner, but want to get to know you, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tips : When you need your audience to be an advocate for you, appeal to his/her specific personality types, respect her needs, answer her expectations, and remember to be specific about the purpose of your meeting.
              </p>
              <h3>2.Practice saying your content out loud before the meeting.</h3>
              <p>This should include your purpose statement, your opening, and your closing. Saying it out loud may prompt you to polish and clarify your first key message.</p>
              <p>Example: “Glad we could be on this call. Today let’s approve the budget to solve overspending in the marketing department…”</p>
              <h3>3.Focus on how you deliver your messages</h3>
              <p>
                What body language should you be using with your audience? What facial expressions? Do you look and sound likeable, believable, and interesting in your presentation?
              </p>
              <h3>4.Do not focus on ‘winning’ everything</h3>
              <p>
                This required to remove your mental block. Do not enter the meeting room if you are still thinking about winning. Negotiation is not a competition where you have to come first. It is a way forward to build lasting relationships, especially in a professional setup. The fact that both the parties have agreed to have a discussion on a particular matter is a sign that you both want to reach mutually benefiting terms of collaboration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tips: Your smile is our biggest sign that you believe what you’re saying. Use inflection to make meaningful words stick.
              </p>
              <h3>5.Mind the language</h3>
              <p>
                Using hesitant and negative language is a big no when it comes to negotiating. Using words, like ‘umm’, ‘I guess so’ and ‘you know’, reduces your power and raises questions on the credibility of your ideas. On the other hand, using negative phrases, such as ‘you’re wrong about this’, or ‘you should not say such a thing’, not only raise eyebrows but also limit a person’s understanding of the substance, making it harder for the speaker to convince the other person about their intentions. According to a study in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, if you want to be communicate with persuasion, don't stumble, pause or use language that shows hesitation. Most importantly, do not give your listeners time to think about what you're really saying, suggests the study.
              </p>
              <h3>6.Mirror your audience’s speed of speech and tone.</h3>
              <p>
                If he/she is serious, you should be serious. If he/she is talking fast, then you should talk fast. This “mirroring and watching” makes negotiations stronger, shows your respect for him or her, and keeps you at equal business stature.
              </p>
              <h3>7.Listen to their “REALLY” emotions: really happy, really excited, or really mad</h3>
              <p>
                What words are they using and what senses do they appeal to? Visual, auditory, or kinesthetic? Stay on that same “sensory mode” during that topic. This improves your bonding and rapport while showing respect.
              </p>
              <p>Example: Audience: “What I see from this situation is that it will take six months to complete.”</p>
              <p>You: “Yes, that’s my perspective, too (visual).”</p>
              <p>Audience: “We need to stomp on this.”</p>
              <p>You: “We can get a jump on it starting Wednesday (kinesthetic).”</p>
              <p>Tips:Their “sensory mode” will likely change with every topic change. </p>
              <p>In using this technique, you relate to them and their point of view, what they are seeing, feeling, and hearing. You listen better, and can address the problem in a constructive way that lets them know that you understand why they are feeling that way and that their feelings are valid.</p>
              <h3>8.Ask open-ended questions</h3>
              <p>
                A negotiator should be fluent and have impeccable communication skills. Your skills to communicate effectively should not be limited to what to say but must rather focus on how to say it. For instance, you don’t want to ask questions that will fetch you nothing more than a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in response. Starting a conversation with questions like, “What are your expectations from the deal?”, or “Do you have any additional ideas in mind to make this collaboration more profitable?”, will help you gain trust as well as give space to the other person to share their interests with clarity.
              </p>
              <h3>9.Share information</h3>
              <p>
                One of the most common mistakes of negotiators is that they try to hide certain facts and figures while discussing the deal. Trust issues have always been a major reason for most failed collaborations in the past. Simply putting out the relevant information is not enough if you want to build good professional tie-ups. You need to be honest and upfront about your current standings and encourage the other to do the same. Do not show all your cards, but make sure to reveal the ones that are conducive to increase the outcome.
